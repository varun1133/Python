###  Analyzing and Visualizing Battery Aging Metrics from the NASA Battery Dataset

#### **Purpose**
This project analyzes the NASA Battery Dataset to understand how key battery parameters—Electrolyte Resistance (**Re**) and Charge Transfer Resistance (**Rct**)—change as the battery ages through charge/discharge cycles. Using interactive Plotly visualizations, we aim to illustrate these trends, offering insights into battery degradation.

#### **Dataset Description**
- **Source**: [NASA Battery Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickfleith/nasa-battery-dataset/data)
- **Content**:
  - Data from Li-ion battery cells subjected to various charge/discharge cycles.
  - Impedance measured via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) over frequencies from 0.1Hz to 5kHz.
  - Aging is tracked through charge/discharge cycles until batteries reach end-of-life (EOL).

#### **Requirements**
To reproduce this analysis, ensure the following prerequisites:
1. **Python Libraries**:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation.
   - `plotly` for interactive visualizations.
   - Install these using `pip install pandas plotly`.

2. **Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in your working directory.

#### **Steps to Run the Code**

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Place the downloaded dataset (`.csv` file) in the same folder as the script or provide its path.

2. **Code Overview**:
   - Load the dataset using `pandas`.
   - Select relevant columns: `Cycle`, `Re`, and `Rct`.
   - Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values).
   - Use Plotly to generate interactive line plots for:
     - **Electrolyte Resistance (Re) vs. Charge/Discharge Cycles**
     - **Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct) vs. Charge/Discharge Cycles**

3. **Execute the Script**:
   - Run the Python script in any IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
   - Interactive plots will open in your browser or embedded in the notebook.

#### **Expected Outputs**
1. **Re (Electrolyte Resistance) vs. Cycle Count**:
   - A line plot showing how electrolyte resistance evolves as the battery ages. 
   - Typically, `Re` increases with aging due to electrolyte degradation.

2. **Rct (Charge Transfer Resistance) vs. Cycle Count**:
   - A line plot visualizing the trend in charge transfer resistance.
   - `Rct` often rises significantly as aging progresses, indicating reduced battery efficiency.

---

#### **Customization**
- Modify axis labels, titles, and themes in the Plotly visualization as needed.
- For additional insights:
  - Include capacity fade as a measure of aging.
  - Analyze temperature dependence if the dataset includes temperature data.
  - Use log-scale plots if resistance values span multiple orders of magnitude.

---

#### **Usage**
This project can help:
1. Researchers study battery aging mechanisms.
2. Engineers design predictive maintenance algorithms for Li-ion batteries.
3. Developers visualize battery health data in real-world applications.

---

#### **Future Enhancements**
- Add multi-dimensional analysis (e.g., impedance vs. frequency across cycles).
- Automate extraction of EOL trends for different cells.
- Integrate machine learning to predict EOL based on `Re`, `Rct`, and cycle data.
